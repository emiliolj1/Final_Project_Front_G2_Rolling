# Proyect_N3_Rolling_Code

About the proyect: 
This project was created for educational purposes to learn programming languages, their tools and their operation. The project includes HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT programming language.


## Getting Started
This is an app created with node.js and vite, if you want to run the project on your own, follow the following steps, you will also need Api Keys to replace the existing ones within the project to be able to run it with your own server.

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Tools used
The tools used to create this page were:

- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/introduction)
- [React-Router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [jsonwebtoken](https://jwt.io/)

>[!TIP]
>If you click on the name of the tools it will take you to its documentation, as always we recommend reading it.

within each name to a link to their respective pages in case you require more information about the tool. 

The Vite tool was also used, if you want more information and documentation about the tool, in the following underlined word of [React + Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) you will be redirected to the corresponding page.
Also in the following template it provides a minimal configuration to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## For the Backend
For the Backend you can follow the steps that we recommend or you can create a Backend on your own, we are only going to guide you in the installation and use by MONGOOSE and the different tools used to create it.
